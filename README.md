# Gender-&-Age-Prediction

This project uses OpenCV and deep learning models to detect faces in images and predict their age and gender. The results are displayed on the image and saved in a designated folder.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images using a pre-trained OpenCV DNN model.
- **Age Prediction**: Predicts the age range of the detected face using a Caffe-based deep learning model.
- **Gender Prediction**: Predicts the gender (Male or Female) of the detected face using a Caffe-based deep learning model.
- **Image Processing**: Processes each image in a specified folder and saves the output with detected faces, predicted age, and gender.
